I.	Introduction
	A.	Introduce us to your corpus

		3.	How large is it?
		4.	How accessible is it?  E.g., is it open-access/source?
	B.	Introduce us to your questions
		1.	What questions are you asking?
		2.	Why are you asking these questions?
			a.	Why are they interesting to you?
			b.	Why should they be of interest to others?
II.	Your methods - Give us a detailed view of what you are doing
	A.	What preprocessing of the texts are you doing?  Why are you doing these?
		1.	lemmatizing/stemming?
		2.	part-of-speech/syntactic analysis?
		3.	semantic analysis?
		4.	In other words, what type of metadata are you adding to improve your analysis results?
	B.	How are you analyzing your texts?
		1.	What features are you using? E.g., words, ngrams, letter ngrams, collocates, co-occurrence, part-of-speech tags, etc.?
		2.	What metrics are you using to measure these features?  Why? (Here, you should be able to point to literature that suggests your methods)

		2.	Or will you have to come up with brand new goals?
IV.	Sell us on your project
	A.	Why should we fund this project further after the end of the Vorlesungszeit?
